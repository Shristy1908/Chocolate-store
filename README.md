Approach behind choosing React library to build Chocolate Store Application-

1.	Choosing React.js: React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building web application. It's known for its component-based architecture and efficient DOM updates. React's virtual DOM ensures fast rendering, making it a suitable choice for building dynamic web applications.

2.	Component-Based Architecture: In React, the application is structured into reusable components. Each component encapsulates its logic and UI, promoting code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

3.	State Management: To manage the application's state, we can choose between React's built-in state management or external state management libraries like Redux. The choice depends on the application's complexity and the need for a predictable state container.

4.	Routing: For handling client-side routing within a single-page application, we can use the React Router library. It allows you to define routes and navigate between different views while keeping the UI in sync with the URL.

5.	Styling: The choice of styling method can depend on personal or team preferences. CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components offer the advantage of scoping styles to individual components, making it easier to manage and avoid global style conflicts.

In conclusion, I choice React.js, because it provide facility of component-based architecture, state management approach, routing with React Router, and styling techniques depend on the specific requirements of the project. These choices aim to provide a scalable, maintainable, and preformat foundation for building modern web applications.
